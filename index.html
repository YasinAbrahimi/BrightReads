      <h2>What is BrightRead?</h2>
      <p><strong>BrightRead</strong> is a simple but powerful educational tool that helps people—especially children with dyslexia—learn the alphabet by associating each letter with its correct sound. When a user clicks a letter, it plays the sound of that letter using speech synthesis.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why BrightRead Exists</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Dyslexia</strong> is a learning difference that affects how people read, write, and interpret letters. Often, letters appear <em>jumbled, mirrored, or confusing</em> to a person with dyslexia.
      </div>
      <p>Imagine trying to learn letters when they constantly move, twist, or blend into one another. For a dyslexic learner, the letter "A" might not look like a clear "A". Instead, it may appear distorted, reversed, or mixed with other shapes.</p>
      <p>BrightRead helps bridge that gap by giving each visual symbol a consistent audio sound. So even when the brain misreads the letter visually, the learner can still recognize it by sound.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The alphabet is displayed clearly in capital letters.</li>
        <li>Each letter is clickable. When clicked, it speaks the sound of the letter using the browser's speech system.</li>
        <li>This builds a mental association: <em>"This shape (letter) always makes this sound."</em></li>
        <li>Over time, even if the letter appears jumbled due to dyslexia, the user will remember the <strong>sound</strong> linked to that visual symbol.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This method taps into the brain’s ability to form audio-visual associations, which is especially helpful for learners with reading difficulties.</p>

      <h2>What Makes BrightRead Unique</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Audio Reinforcement</strong>: Sound is instant. Letters don't just sit there; they talk!</li>
        <li><strong>Simple UI</strong>: The interface is clean, bright, and inviting—perfect for early learners.</li>
        <li><strong>No Distractions</strong>: No ads, no clutter, no confusion. Just the alphabet and audio.</li>
        <li><strong>Based on Cognitive Research</strong>: Sound-to-symbol mapping helps bypass visual confusion in dyslexia.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>What Happens When a Dyslexic Learner Sees a Letter</h2>
      <p>Dyslexic brains process letters differently. Here's a simplified model:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A learner sees the letter "B".</li>
        <li>The brain might perceive it as "D", "P", or "13" due to shape similarity.</li>
        <li>The learner clicks the letter.</li>
        <li>BrightRead says "B".</li>
        <li>The brain hears "B" and reinforces that "this shape = 'B' sound", regardless of the visual confusion.</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="highlight">
        BrightRead makes it safe to make mistakes. The sound is always there to guide the user back to the correct letter identity.
      </div>

      <h2>Who's It For?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Children with dyslexia</li>
        <li>Early learners (age 3–7)</li>
        <li>Parents and teachers supporting struggling readers</li>
        <li>Anyone learning the English alphabet</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Future of BrightRead</h2>
      <p>This is just the beginning! BrightRead can expand to include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phonics sounds (e.g. "sh", "ch", "th")</li>
        <li>Letter tracing activities with sound</li>
        <li>Word formation games</li>
        <li>Progress tracking for parents and teachers</li>
      </ul>
